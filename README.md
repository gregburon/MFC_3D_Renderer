# MFC_3D_Renderer
This is a 3D renderer written from scratch as part of a graphics class I took in college. It is a polygon renderer written in Win32 that renders pre-made 3D files. It was my first attempt at learning 3D; using basic Windows GDI calls to do all the plotting from the ground up to build triangles of 3-dimensional shapes. I learned a ton about 3D in developing this application.
