This first picture is of four models positioned in the render area in simple wireframe
mode.  The Objects with the green lines is the "current object" which the user can modify
with the transformations palette.

Using the depth cue rendering technique, the models are still in wire frame mode, but the colors of 
the wire frame are modified according to the distance from the observer, giving the wire frame model more 
of a concept of "depth".<br>

uses backface elimination.</b>

Models rendered with backface elimination hides facets that the user cannot see by not drawing them.

The painter's algorithm draws solid facets of the object, and colors them with light equations that 
are set up in the light parameters dialog box.  Here this picture shows the objects in Painter's drawing mode. 
The colors of the facets here are somewhat distorted because this file is of .gif format.<br>
